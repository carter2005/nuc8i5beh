clover/opencore uefi bootloader for Mojave, Catalina, and Big Surf

# Bios

- Disable **Secure Boot**

- Disable **Wi-Fi**, wifi works now by ltlwm.kext, but I use ethernet

# Hardware

- CPU: Intel® Core™ i5-8259U Processor (6M Cache, up to 3.80 GHz)
- SSD: S750 512GB
- RAM: Kingston HyperX 8GB x 2
- BIOS: 0073

# Status

- Mojave 10.14.6 OK
- Catalina 10.15.7 OK

- works perfect with native power, graphics, ethernet, audio and bluetooth, wifi need enable by itlwm.kext manually.

# QnA

1. macbook pro 15.2 vs macmini 8,1

   could work on both configuration, but mbp is much more energy save than macmini(typical 8W vs 12W) and bluetooth is more easier to work.
